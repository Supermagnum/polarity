This PCB board is 31mm in diameter, it has a single P-Channel IRLR9343TRPBF mosfet that is capable of tolerating 20V 20A. 
It should be fairly simple to solder, even that it is surface mounted. 

It does not conduct any electricity if subjected to the wrong polarity. 

It has two 11mm solder pads,the one on the DC+ OUT protected side can be soldered to the top of your existing drivers spring,or a wire. 
There is also a DC- or ground connection solder connection or a outer circular connection that is suitable for a snap ring or compression connection, 
I suggest a AVG 15 (1.45 mm diameter ) flexible wire for a solder connetion. 
The DC+ unprotected side goes to the batteries. It is possible to solder a spring there if needed.
